# _D3DKMT_WORKINGSETFLAGS structure



## -description
The D3DKMT_WORKINGSETFLAGS structure identifies working-set properties of the display miniport driver that the OpenGL installable client driver (ICD) obtains by calling the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtqueryadapterinfo.md">D3DKMTQueryAdapterInfo</a> function.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _D3DKMT_WORKINGSETFLAGS {
  UINT UseDefault  :1;
  UINT Reserved  :31;
} D3DKMT_WORKINGSETFLAGS;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field UseDefault

A UINT value that specifies whether the display miniport driver uses the default working set.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of a 32-bit value (0x00000001).


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the remaining 31 bits (0xFFFFFFFE) of a 32-bit value to zeros.
